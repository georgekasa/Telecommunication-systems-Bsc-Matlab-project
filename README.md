# Telecommunication-systems-Bsc-Matlab-project
This project had 2 parts, 
the first part was to simulate how a transimitter which transmits 2 symbols and 4  symbols afterwards this symbols will add (Gaussian) noise and the receivers must classify the symbols of the noise symbols. Afterwards we plot the theoretical probability with the experimental to see the differences vs the SNR.
 The second part is almost the same as the first, but now the transmitter sends a PICTURE with 2 symbols and the receiver must recreate again this picture
The project was a part of Bsc degree for the course of Telecommunication systems, with Matlab
